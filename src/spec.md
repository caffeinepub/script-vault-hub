## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the existing app icon with the new circular Rawly41 logo featuring pink dripping text on a turquoise swirl background.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all app icon files (192x192, 512x512, and 180x180 Apple touch icon) with the new circular Rawly41 logo
- Update manifest.json to reference the new icon files
- Update index.html Apple touch icon link to point to the new icon

**User-visible outcome:** When the app is installed as a PWA or viewed on a device home screen, it displays the new circular Rawly41 logo with pink dripping text on a turquoise swirl background with white border.
