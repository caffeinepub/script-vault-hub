# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the missing scripts functionality so users can view, manage, and interact with scripts throughout the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix the homepage to display all public scripts in the ScriptGrid component
- Restore the My Scripts page to show authenticated user's scripts with edit and delete functionality
- Ensure script detail pages load and display individual script content with syntax highlighting
- Verify backend script CRUD operations are returning data correctly to frontend queries

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse all public scripts on the homepage, manage their own scripts on the My Scripts page, and view detailed script information on individual script pages.
